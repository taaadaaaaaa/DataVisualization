                                In the chart for Canada, we observe a significant increase in the immigrant population from 2018 to 2019. Many immigrants chose Canada as their destination for economic opportunities and to secure a better future for their families. This surge in immigration can be attributed to the restrictions on permanent residency imposed during Donald Trump's presidency in the neighboring United States.</br>
                                <br>However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on immigration between 2020 and 2021, leading to a sharp decline in the number of immigrants coming to Canada. Despite this, there was a positive trend in the proportion of economic immigrants, with a notable increase in 2021. These skilled foreign workers played a vital role in Canada's economic recovery from the pandemic.</br>
                                <br>Additionally, there was a slight increase in the percentage of refugees migrating to Canada during this period, likely influenced by the political upheaval in Afghanistan caused by the Taliban coup in 2021. Many Afghan refugees sought safety and freedom from the civil unrest and oppression, finding solace in Canada. </br>
                                <br>Overall, these trends in Canada's immigration patterns reflect the complex interplay between global events, economic opportunities, and the search for safety and stability.

                                <p>Let’s delve into the economic context of Canadian immigration. Canada’s economic indexes were relatively stable over time, until 2020, when COVID-19 began. The GDP growth of Canada plummeted in 2020, following a surge in the unemployment rate. Fortunately, the Canadian economy was rapidly recovered in 2021, and its GDP growth was even higher than before. One of the factors leading to this amazing recovery is the change in the proportions of immigrant groups. As mentioned above, the economic immigrants percentage rose substantially during 2021, contributing to the GDP growth of Canada.</p>
